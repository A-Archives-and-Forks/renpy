    :doc: color class
    :args: (color=None, hls=None, hsv=None, rgb=None, alpha=1.0)
    :name: Color

    The Color class is used to represent and manipulate colors and convert
    between various color spaces. It also represents opacity in the form
    of an alpha.

    When creating a Color, at most one of the `color`, `hls`, `hsv`, or
    `rgb` arguments should be supplied. (If all are None, None is returned.)

    `color`
        The color, in one of the standard formats Ren'Py understands. These
        are:

        * A Color object.
        * An (r, g, b) or (r, g, b, a) tuple, in which all the numbers are
          between 0 and 255.
        * A string giving a hexadecimal color, in the form "#rgb", "#rgba",
          "#rrggbb", or "#rrggbbaa".

    `hls`
        A color in the hue-lightness-saturation color space. This should
        be supplied a three-component tuple, where each component is between
        0.0 and 1.0.

    `hsv`
        A color in the hue-saturation-value color space. This should
        be supplied a three-component tuple, where each component is between
        0.0 and 1.0.

    `rgb`
        A color in the red-green-blue color space. This should
        be supplied a three-component tuple, where each component is between
        0.0 and 1.0.

    If the supplied color does not contain an alpha value, `alpha` is used.
    `alpha` must be between 0.0 and 1.0.

    Color objects can be used as 4-component tuples, where the components
    are (red, green, blue, and alpha). When used as a tuple, the value
    of each component is between 0 and 255.

    Color objects support the +, -, and * operators, representing
    component-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Some uses
    of these operators can cause the creation of colors with components
    that are not in the supported range. Such colors should not be passed
    to other parts of Ren'Py. (The normalize method can be called to return
    a new color with the components limited to the proper range.)

    A Color object has the following properties:

    .. attribute:: hls

        Returns the color as a tuple of three floating point numbers giving
        hue, lightness, and saturation. Each component ranges between 0.0 and 1.0.

    .. attribute:: hsv

        Returns the color as a tuple of three floating point numbers giving
        hue, saturation, and value. Each component ranges between 0.0 and 1.0.

    .. attribute:: rgb

        Returns the color as a tuple of three floating point numbers giving
        the red, green, and blue components. Each component ranges between 0.0
        and 1.0.

    .. attribute:: rgba

        Returns the color as a tuple of four floating point numbers giving
        the red, green, blue and alpha components as 0.0 to 1.0 values.

    .. attribute:: premultiplied

        Returns the color as a tuple of four floating point numbers giving
        the red, green, blue and alpha components as 0.0 to 1.0 values, with
        the red, green, and blue components premultiplied by the alpha.

    .. attribute:: alpha

        Returns the alpha (opacity) of this Color as a number between 0.0 and
        1.0, where 0.0 is transparent and 1.0 is opaque.

    .. attribute:: hexcode

        Returns a string containing a hex color code of the form #rrggbbaa
        or #rrggbb.

    Color objects have the following methods. Since Colors are immutable,
    these methods always return a new Color object.
